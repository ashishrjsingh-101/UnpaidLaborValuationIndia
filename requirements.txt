Abstract
This paper develops a transparent, replication-ready framework to quantify the present value of unpaid household labor in Indian marriages using India's Time Use Survey 2019 for task hours, task-specific replacement-cost wages, level and growing annuity models, and Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis.

Baseline unpaid labor present values are ₹580,798 (level annuity) and ₹1,455,718 under growth-adjusted valuation with a 20% emotional labor premium, reflecting the valuation range across static and dynamic specifications.

Across policy-relevant scenarios, net contribution gaps favor male monetary inputs by approximately ₹0.74 million to ₹13.39 million, with growth assumptions amplifying disparities when male expenses scale at similar rates.

In 10,000-iteration simulations, the probability of male financial advantage ranges from about 91.1% to 98.8% across scenarios, indicating robustness to parameter uncertainty and modeling choices.

Sensitivity analyses identify discount and growth rates as high-impact levers, while policy simulations highlight wage growth policies and care infrastructure as credible pathways to narrow gaps without double counting across valuation tracks.

All code, parameter logs, and data provenance are provided in the replication repository to enable audit, replication, and cross-jurisdictional adaptation of the framework.
